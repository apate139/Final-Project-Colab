# Background 
Healthy food availability is a growing concern in Baltimore, MD. Recent reports have found that [23.5% of Baltimore residents](https://planning.baltimorecity.gov/sites/default/files/City%20Map%20Brief%20011218.pdf) live in healthy food priority areas, which means they lack consistent access to healthy food and healthy food providers. The Baltimore City Health Department has partnered with the Center for a Liveable Future at Johns Hopkins University and created special programs to target these areas, like Baltimarket and Food Justice Forums. They also created a [Food Policy and Planning Iniative](https://planning.baltimorecity.gov/resident-food-equity-advisors) which has expanded programs to include subsidies for growing fresh produce, incentives for store owners increasing healthy food availability, and feedback from food equity advisors who are community members. Given the increased focus on healthy food availability, we seek to examine how healthy food availability varies throughout Baltimore City and how it relates to median household income.  


# Data Question 1 and Map
## How do 2015 HFAI scores compare across Community Statistical Areas in Baltimore City? 

The map puts HFAI score clusters from the cluster analysis in context with geographic areas in Baltimore City. The majority of community statistical areas in Baltimore City have HFAI scores of less than 9.2 and statistical areas with similar HFAI appear to be located next to each other. Statistical areas with HFAI scores between 11.25 and 16 are located in close together and border the Baltimore waterfront. ![alt text](https://github.com/apate139/Geospatial-Analysis-of-Healthy-Food-Availability-Scores-and-Fast-Food-Outlet-Density-in-Baltimore-MD/blob/main/Average%20HFAI%202015%20Map.png)

# Data Question 2 and Map 
## How does 2015 median household income compare with 2015 HFAI scores across Community Statistical Areas in Baltimore City? 

The map shows median household income of each community statistical area and puts HFAI scores in context with financial constraints, a possible factor affecting HFAI scores. Overall, higher income areas correspond to higher HFAI scores. Areas with lower HFAI scores somewhat correspond to lower income areas, however areas with median household incomes of $30,000-$45000 have both medium and low HFAI scores. ![alt text](https://github.com/apate139/Geospatial-Analysis-of-Healthy-Food-Availability-Scores-and-Fast-Food-Outlet-Density-in-Baltimore-MD/blob/main/Median%20Household%20Income%202015%20Map.png)
